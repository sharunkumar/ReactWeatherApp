Task:2 - 

-   Build a weather forecasting application using REACT
-   Display a 5-day weather forecast, showing high and low temperatures each day and an image for sunny/rainy/cloudy/snowy. Use fake, hard-coded data until you've got everything rendering correctly.
-   Add the ability to click on a day and see its hourly forecast. You can maintain the current view in the top-level App state.
-   Add React Router to the project (npm install react-router) and add routes such that / shows the 5-day forecast, and /[name-of-day] shows the hourly forecast for a particular day.
-   Sign up for a free API key from [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/)
-   Fetch a real 5-day forecast, and feed that data into your app.
